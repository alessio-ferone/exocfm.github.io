# Atmospheric Retrieval of Exoplanets with Conditional Flow Matching: 
[Awarded Nvidia Academic Grant](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/industries/higher-education-research/academic-grant-program/")
## Call for Proposal: Data Science
NVIDIA has been transforming computer graphics and accelerated computing for more than 25 years. We're defining the next era of scientific computing and supporting top researchers doing compelling, computationally intense work to solve the world's most challenging problems. The NVIDIA Developer Program supports researchers in using our SDKs, frameworks, and web services by providing training and creating online communities to help researchers do their life's work using NVIDIA hardware and software.

NVIDIA solicits funding proposals for innovative work related to data science that incorporates NVIDIA RAPIDS, cuPy, cuOpt, cuDF, cuGraph, or PhysicsNeMo.

Our proposal is attached to the section of *Statistical Methods*, which focuses on the development or application of novel statistical techniques, addressing challenges such as big data analytics, predictive modeling, or the handling of uncertainty in data. Research areas of interest may include:
> Exploring the intersection of statistics with machine learning and artificial intelligence.


## 🔍 Abstract
The characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres allows a deeper understanding of planetary systems through atmospheric retrieval. Traditional sampling-based methods become impractical due to high computational cost, requiring several weeks to compute the full posterior distribution. We propose an atmospheric retrieval framework based on Continuous Normalizing Flows trained with Conditional Flow Matching, allowing for scalable training and inference, and a robust uncertainty quantification.

**Project Keywords.** 
Conditional Flow Matching, deep generative models, Bayesian uncertainty quantification, atmospheric retrieval, exoplanetary atmospheres
