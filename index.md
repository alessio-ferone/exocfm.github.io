## 🔍 Abstract
The characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres allows a deeper understanding of planetary systems
through atmospheric retrieval. Traditional sampling-based methods become impractical due to high
computational cost, requiring several weeks to compute the full posterior distribution. We propose an
atmospheric retrieval framework based on Continuous Normalizing Flows trained with Conditional Flow
Matching, allowing for scalable training and inference, and a robust uncertainty quantification.
